# Quality Assessment of Machine and LLM-driven Translation Training Dataset

## Overview

This repository contains the dataset used in the "Quality Assessment of Machine and LLM-driven Translation" course. This dataset was compiled and developed as part of **João Lucas Cavalheiro Camargo's PhD thesis** at **Dublin City University**. The dataset is designed for pedagogical use, providing examples that illustrate various challenges in machine translation (MT) evaluation. It supports students in understanding evaluation methodologies and the impact of translation quality across different domains.

## Purpose of the Dataset

The dataset is intended for **educational and research purposes**, enabling students and researchers to:

- Explore the strengths and weaknesses of machine translation systems.
- Investigate automatic and human evaluation methods.
- Analyse translation errors and linguistic challenges.
- Use it for human evaluation, automatic evaluation, or pedagogical exercises that teachers may design.

## How to Use the Dataset

Download the dataset files and use them for any relevant evaluation or pedagogical activity. These files can be applied in various scenarios, including:

- Conducting human evaluation of machine-translated outputs.
- Running automatic evaluation metrics to assess MT performance.
- Designing pedagogical exercises for teaching MT quality assessment.
