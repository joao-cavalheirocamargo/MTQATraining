<seg id="1">	One of the best Switch games in an edition you can't miss
<seg id="2">	Reviewed in Spain on 1 July 2024
<seg id="3">	If you're a Zelda fan, you have to get hold of this great game, especially if you enjoyed the open world of Breath of the Wild.
<seg id="4">	Now the exploration is divided into 3 places (the ground, the sky and the mysterious and dangerous subsoil), and the possibilities of creation are truly breathtaking.
<seg id="5">	Better dungeons, bosses, more variety of weapons, puzzles, challenges... 
<seg id="6">	The collector's edition is essential for fans, it comes with a mini-artbook with some illustrations, a metallic steelbook, a beautiful metallic poster as well and an original collection of pins.
<seg id="7">	Personally, I liked the Breath of the Wild edition better, but this one is very elegant and doesn't come out as expensive if we think that the game's official PVP is 70 euros.

<seg id="1">	Uncle Niall the King of Everything 
<seg id="2">	Reviewed in Brazil on 10 May 2022
<seg id="3">	Much better than the first, here the highlight goes entirely to Niall! 
<seg id="4">	I imagined that the second book would focus more on the past and on the minds of Mateo and Jack, but Uncle Niall is the main protagonist (at least for me).
<seg id="5">	Brooke really wasn't a character whose personality captivated me. 
<seg id="6">	I like her courage and strength, but her insane mind is more childish and her digressions bothered me, as did her obsession with candies and silly things.
<seg id="7">	I think I like adult-minded psychos better. 
<seg id="8">	This is a very peculiar harem that is different from all the ones I've read.
<seg id="9">	Although Brooke is the woman that the three of them love and are obsessed with, Uncle Niall rules them all - not that I'm complaining. 
<seg id="10">	I found that the other two men are there more as supporting actors, one to follow Niall's orders and the other to go head-on with him. 
<seg id="11">	In this book we have more action, more hot, more violence and deaths.
<seg id="12">	But all with a lot of humor, which didn't cause the reading to arouse many emotions in me.  
<seg id="13">	I think I can blame myself for having created a wrong expectation... 
<seg id="14">	especially with the change of the covers, I imagined a heavier and more dramatic reading, but ended up having a lot of laughs...
<seg id="15">	even in the death and hot scenes.

<seg id="1">	Monumental translation of Flora Thomson-deveaux!
<seg id="2">	Reviewed in Brazil on 26 August 2020
<seg id="3">	A Herculean work by Flora Thomson-deveaux, an American based in Rio de Janeiro, to translate Machado de Assis's genius into English.
<seg id="4">	For example, Flora consulted dictionaries of time so that each translated word had the meaning that Machado intended to give to the words used.
<seg id="5">	A masterful translation work that took years to match the importance of the Wizard of the Old Cosme.
<seg id="6">	I hope the work continues with high blindings (sold out in one day in the USA) so that the greatest Brazilian writer has deserved worldwide recognition.
<seg id="7">	Thank you very much, Flora!
